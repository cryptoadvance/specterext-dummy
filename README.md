This is a template repository for a minimal extension which should get you started if you want to contribute to specter via an 
extension.
More information about Specter Extension Programming can be found [here](https://docs.specter.solutions/desktop/extensions/intro/).

# Get it to run

In oder to use this:
```
mkdir specterext-myextension && cd specterext-myextension
# Will work with version > 1.8.1 
# pip3 install virtualenv
# virtualenv --python=python3 .env
# source .env/bin/activate
# pip3 install cryptoadvance.specter
source ../specter-desktop/.env/bin/activate # assuming you have a specter-desktop checked out there
python3 -m cryptoadvance.specter ext gen
# Follow the instructions ...
```

# How to get this to production?
The above setup is describing a Development Environment for your extension. If you ommit the `--config DevelopmentConfig`, it'll no longer work. We don't want in a ProductionConfig, that arbitrary files get imported by python.
So in order to specify explicitely which extensions to load, there is a list in the [ProductionConfig](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/blob/master/src/cryptoadvance/specter/config.py#L146-L150). So what you need to do is to first, switch the `devstatus` in your `DummyService`-class to production and then create your own relevant configuration and specify the extensions you want to load.
You could do that e.g. by creating a file in `./src/mynym/specterext/dummy/app_config.py` with this content:
There is already an example in the folder when you generate the extension.
```
from cryptoadvance.specter.config import ProductionConfig


class Config(ProductionConfig):
    EXTENSION_LIST=[
        "dummy.service"
    ]
```

Then you'd start specter like this:
```
python3 -m cryptoadvance.specter server --config dummy.appconfig.Config
```

It's also possible, that you publish your extension on PyPi and use a fully qualified module-name in the `EXTENSION_LIST`. Obviously, you would need to install that in your (virtual-) environment in that case.
